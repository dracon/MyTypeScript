# Test Project for TypeScript and Angular2 understanding
It's not always easy to understand new systems, frameworks and all that stuff.
Now, this project is meant to give me the understanding of TypeScript used in Angular2 and the way Angular2 is working.

## ECMA2015 / ES6
I like to understand how the new JavaScript standard works and how to code for it.
Using tools to translate ES6 to ES5 for the browsers and find out when it's time to move on and use only ES6.
